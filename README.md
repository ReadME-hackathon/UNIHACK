# GroupSpace

GroupSpace is a platform designed to revolutionize team projects.

## Inspiration

At the start of every semester, the anxiety of group assignments looms large. Coordinating schedules, aligning work styles, and managing different goals pose significant challenges. Recognizing these difficulties, we envisioned a platform where students could effortlessly connect with like-minded peers for group projects or study sessions.

## What it does

GroupSpace is a web application that allows tutors to create virtual spaces where students can connect based on shared criteria such as availability, target grades, hobbies, and more. Students can input their preferences, facilitating both self-promotion and the discovery of suitable group mates.

## How we built it

- **Front end:** React, TypeScript, tailwindcss, shadcn UI library
- **Backend:** Node.js, Firebase. Code can be found in `/functions`.
- **Illustrations:** ClipStudioPaint, Adobe Illustrator
- We received valuable guidance from mentors throughout the process.

## Challenges we ran into

Initially, we encountered a setback when we discovered an existing competitor offering similar features to our original idea. Undeterred, we pivoted and developed GroupSpace. Despite our determination, we faced challenges with time management and frontend-backend integration. Additionally, aligning UI designs with database structures posed hurdles that required reevaluation and adjustment.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our journey began with strong Figma designs, leading to a simple and elegant UI. We successfully implemented the backend and achieved a functional web app with live data. Although we shelved certain planned features due to time constraints, our team's clear communication and efficient task delegation were notable achievements.

## What we learned

This project provided valuable learning experiences for all team members, requiring us to delve into new technologies such as shadcn and Firebase. We honed our ability to collaborate effectively and navigate differing opinions, skills essential for successful teamwork.

## What's next for GroupSpace

- Enable all users to create and customize their own spaces for diverse applications.
- Implement a matching engine or compatibility metric to facilitate better user discovery.
- Enhance user experience with features such as profile and space editing functionalities.
